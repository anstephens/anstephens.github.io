											<h3>Every Dog Austin</h3>
											<p style="text-align:justify">As a lifelong animal-lover, I can't imagine my life without dogs. After training a therapy dog in high school, I fell in love with the training process and began to see the value of teaching people how to train their dogs well. In a city as dog-friendly as Austin, it's important for dogs to be able to handle themselves in public. This can be a difficult task, and training a dog alone is not an easy undertaking. So when I moved to Austin with my crazy six-month-old Lab, Moose, I sought training help and came across Every Dog. They are a non-profit dog training organization in Austin that aims to make dog training accessible to everyone - including shelter dogs!</p>
											<p style="text-align:justify">After Moose and I completed first six-week course, I wanted to get more involved. I have been volunteering as an assistant to trainers in classes, and I helped organize and set up the Grand Opening party of a new training facility. Dog training has often been exclusionary and cost-prohibitive to dog owners, so providing resources, free services, and financial aid opens up these opportunities to dog lovers and gives difficult dogs a second chance. Check out their mission <a href="https://www.everydogaustin.org">here</a>.</p>

											<h3>Engineers Without Borders</h3>
										</header>
										<p style="text-align:justify">During my five years of undergrad, I was heavily involved with the UW's chapter of <a href="http://ewbuwmadison.weebly.com">Engineers Without Borders</a> (EWB). EWB is a student-led national organization that works with domestic and international communities to fundraise for, design, and implement civil works projects that empower communities to meet their basic needs. From the spring of my freshman year until the end of my junior year, I started and led EWB-USA's first project in Puerto Rico. We raised $165,000 through corporate sponsorships, private donors, and material donations to design and implement a photovoltaic solar array for a shelter in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico that serves children who were removed from their homes due to abuse or neglect.</p>
										<p style="text-align:justify">Following my stint as Project Manager, I became my chapter's Vice President of Project Managers, acting as a liaison between projects and the executive board, and assisting project leaders for five international projects. For my final year of undergrad, I was the President of the UW chapter, handling the coordination of our five projects, the executive board, our sponsors, our communities, the university, and EWB-USA.</p>

											<h3>Science Outreach</h3>
										</header>
										<p style="text-align:justify">While I lived in Madison, WI, I worked closely with community outreach groups to mentor high school students in the local community and provide STEM learning opportunities to younger students in the area. I visited local middle schools to help robotics students learn basic coding, created and ran workshops for a monthly children’s science expo, and organized a booth for the Wisconsin Science Festival, a statewide celebration geared towards kindling interest in STEM.</p>
										<p style="text-align:justify">Ever since graduating high school, I have worked with my former environmental science teacher to present my research in her classroom. I have met with many older students in her classes to help them brainstorm ways to join their scientific passions and their academic strengths to find degree programs that set them on track towards their career goals. In my new role at the University of Texas, I hope to find similar opportunities to work within my local community to advance science outreach and work with students during their formative years.
